<p id="p"> So here it is! Do you love Lebron James? When you think about this legend, you think of a winner. His passion for the game, his love for the game, while others are sleeping he is working.

Three championships, ended a fifty-one year drought to bring a championship to the city of Cleveland. Many still dought his abilities because of how many times he has reached the NBA finals! In the past ten years Lebron has made it there eight out of ten times.

Being in the conversation of the best basketball player in the world is already an accomplishment, but think James is only thirty one years old. Having about four to five years left to still play, Lebron can break every record by a long shot being in the top ten in every stat category already.

This is his moment now, back with his best friend Dwayne Wade and additional add-ons they got this following year makes it exciting. The sky is the limit for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Will  the Dark Knight rise again? <p>
